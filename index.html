    <p>I am an Assistant Professor of Politics and International Affairs at Princeton Univeristy. My research lies at the
    intersection of Comparative Politics, Gender and Politics, and the Political Economy of Development. 
	    I am interested in understanding the cause and consequences of gender inequality, and in analyzing policy interventions that lower gender inequality in politics. My work leverages a range of research
    designs and data sources, including natural experiments, large-scale surveys, ethnographic research, and administrative data.</p>

    <p>Previously, I was a post-doctoral scholar at the <a
      href="https://academy.wcfia.harvard.edu">Harvard Academy</a>. I am affiliated as a non-resident visiting fellow with the <a href="https://casi.sas.upenn.edu">Center for the Advanced Study of India, UPenn</a>. I completed my PhD in Political Science in 2021 at the </a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk">University of Oxford</a>, where I was a member of </a href="https://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk">Nuffield College</a>. 
      

    <p>

  Based on my <a href="https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:6bb8a8f6-7e8a-45c8-a4d8-073331a7fac5">dissertation</a>, my book manuscript "Active women" examines the political economy logic underlying descriptive representation and party activism and its effects on political participation, governance, and party building in the Global South. I rely on natural experiments in the Indian and the Brazilian case. I propose a new perspective on how marginalized groups leverage descriptive representation, demonstrating that women politicians bring about change because they are more likely than men to recruit women as grassroots party activists. 
	    My book manuscript demonstrates how women's collective action emerges inside parties and how it is a force for social and political change.

      <b><a href="https://osf.io/nhwxs/">Local Newspaper Decline and Political Polarization in Multi-Party Systems
    
        </a></b>
      (With Fabio Ellger, Sascha Riaz and Philipp Tillman). Accepted, <i> British Journal of Political Science.</i>
    
      <i><a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('newspaper2');">[Abstract]</a></i>
      <div id="newspaper2" style="display:none;"><br> How does the decline of local news affect political polarization? We
        provide novel panel evidence on this question in a multi-party setting. In particular, we shed light on the link between newspaper exits, media consumption, and ultimately electoral behavior. To study the aggregate relationship  between local news exits and polarization, we rely on a unique panel of all German local newspapers between 1980 and
        2009. In addition, we precisely trace individual-level mechanisms by drawing on an annual media consumption survey
        of more than 670,000 respondents over three decades. Using a difference-in-differences design, we demonstrate that
        local newspaper exits increase electoral polarization, which aligns with evidence from the American context. Going
        beyond prior work, we then document that local news exits increase polarization because affected constituents
        substitute local news with national tabloid news. Finally, we show that local news exits increase politicization and
        partisanship at the individual level.

        <b><a href="https://osf.io/cf8ut">Electoral Constraints on Affordable Housing</a></b> (with Andreas Wiedemann). Revise &#38; Resubmit, <i> American Journal of Political Science.</i>
      
        <i><a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('housing');">[Abstract]</a></i>
        <div id="housing" style="display:none;"><br>Housing shortages and rising rents have increased demands for affordable housing. In this paper, we propose that
        electoral constraints can undermine local politicians' incentives to build public housing. This occurs because voters'
        diverging preferences for spending conflict with municipalities' long-term goals to provide affordable housing.
        Empirically, we draw on the full-count census of all housing built in Germany, data on 19,671 local elections between
        1989 and 2011, and an original survey. Using a difference-in-differences design, we demonstrate that local incumbents
        experience moderate electoral losses after constructing new public housing. We then show that these losses are not
        driven by homeowner opposition or native-foreigner competition. Instead, we develop a novel argument that voters punish
        local incumbents for new municipal housing when they prefer spending on other prioritized policy domains. Our results
        have implications for the origins of the affordability crisis and suggest potential strategies to mitigate electoral
        constraints.
