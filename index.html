    <p>I am an Assistant Professor of Politics and International Affairs at Princeton Univeristy. My research lies at the
    intersection of Comparative Politics, Gender and Politics, and the Political Economy of Development. I am interested in understanding the cause and consequences of gender inequality, and in analyzing policy interventions that lower gender inequality in politics. My work leverages a range of research
    designs and data sources, including natural experiments, large-scale surveys, ethnographic research, and administrative data.</p>

    <p>Previously, I was a post-doctoral scholar at the <a
      href="https://academy.wcfia.harvard.edu">Harvard Academy for International and Area Studies, Harvard University</a>. I continue to be affiliated as a non-resident visiting fellow with the <\a href="https://casi.sas.upenn.edu">Center for the Advanced Study of India, UPenn</a>. I completed my PhD in Political Science in 2021 at the </a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk">University of Oxford</a>, where I was a member of </a href="https://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk">Nuffield College</a>. 
      

    <p>

  Based on my <a href="https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:6bb8a8f6-7e8a-45c8-a4d8-073331a7fac5">dissertation</a>, my book manuscript "Active women" examines the political economy logic underlying descriptive representation and party activism and its effects on political participation, governance, and party building in the Global South. I rely on natural experiments and data in the Indian and the Brazilian case. I propose a new perspective on how descriptive representation has positive spillovers for democracy, demonstrating that women politicians bring about change because they are more likely than men to recruit women as grassroots party activists. My book manuscript demonstrates how women's collective action emerges inside parties and how it is a force for social and political change. 

  <!--In particular, I analyze how the nationalization of media transforms local policymaking across three central challenges facing democracies: economic crises, immigration, and climate change. In my dissertation, I explore how local governments respond to adverse economic shocks. In my <b> <a href="papers/HannoHilbig_JMP.pdf">job market paper</a></b>, I study how the Great Recession affected local tax policy in Germany. In additional published and ongoing research, I examine three related research areas: (i) the relationship between economic inequality and political behavior, (ii) economic disparities between immigrants and natives (iii) how growing regional disparities in local news presence affect polarization and political knowledge.-->

      <div id="newspaper2" style="display:none;"><br> How does the decline of local news affect political polarization? We
        provide novel panel evidence on this question in a multi-party setting. In particular, we shed light on the link between newspaper exits, media consumption, and ultimately electoral behavior. To study the aggregate relationship  between local news exits and polarization, we rely on a unique panel of all German local newspapers between 1980 and
        2009. In addition, we precisely trace individual-level mechanisms by drawing on an annual media consumption survey
        of more than 670,000 respondents over three decades. Using a difference-in-differences design, we demonstrate that
        local newspaper exits increase electoral polarization, which aligns with evidence from the American context. Going
        beyond prior work, we then document that local news exits increase polarization because affected constituents
        substitute local news with national tabloid news. Finally, we show that local news exits increase politicization and
        partisanship at the individual level.

    in the center-periphery conflicts of modern nation-state formation. Inspired by a classic state-building literature
    that emphasizes the prevalence of a “wealth of tongues” (Weber 1976)— or nonstandard linguistic dialects in a
    region—as a definition of the periphery, we use data from more than 725,000 geo-coded responses in a linguistic

          significantly eased labor market access for refugees in the majority of the country. Using administrative employment
          data, we show that the policy led to a substantial increase in refugee employment, while natives' wages and
          employment rates remained unaffected. The policy also had a \textit{positive} effect on natives' attitudes toward
          migration. Voters exposed to more refugees in the labor market were two percentage points more likely to vote for
          pro-migration parties across both state and federal elections. Additional survey analyses suggest that our results
          are driven by positive native-refugee interactions in the workplace.

  <div id="flood" style="display:none;"><br> A growing literature shows that extreme weather events induce
    pro-environment attitudes. We examine the political effects of a severe flood shortly before the 2021 German federal
    election. Drawing on about 600,000 survey responses and electoral data, we assess how flooding affected (i) the
    perceived salience of climate change, (ii) self-reported Green Party support, and (iii) Green Party voting in
    federal elections. We find that even severe local flooding had little to no effect on these outcomes. Additional
    evidence supports two mechanisms underlying this finding: nationwide rather than local effects of severe disasters,
    and voter demands for disaster relief rather than climate change prevention. We test the former mechanism using a
    regression discontinuity design and find that the flood increased nationwide Green Party support, although this
    effect persists for only two weeks. Our results shed new light on the precise duration and geographic scope of the
    political effects of natural disasters.

  <i><a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('census');">[Abstract]</a></i>
  <div id="census" style="display:none;"><br> Does government spending on public goods affect the vote choice of
    citizens? On the one hand, voters have been
    characterized as "fiscal conservatives" who may turn toward conservative parties when government spending goes up.
    Onthe other hand, increased spending may signal that the economy is doing well, which makes progressive parties a
    more viable option. To adjudicate between both hypotheses, this paper draws on a natural experiment, which created
    exogenous variation in government spending. A discontinuity in the 2011 German census meant that some municipalities
    saw an unforeseen increase in budgets. Using a regression discontinuity design, we show that the increase in budgets
    and subsequent spending on public goods benefited left-leaning parties, but had no effect on incumbent support. To
    parse out the causal channel, we rely on panel evidence and demonstrate that treated residents viewed their economic
    situation more favorably, which led them to espouse progressive parties.

We posit that indirect exposure to information from multiple sources leads to more accurate beliefs in competitive markets. To causally identify the effect of local news monopolies on misperceptions, we exploit overlapping newspaper coverage areas as a source of
    exogenous variation in the number of available outlets. We estimate that local news monopolies increase misperceptions about the size of the local immigrant population by about four percentage points. We demonstrate that the effect of media monopolies hinges on social interactions. For individuals with fewer close social contacts, misperceptions remain unaffected by local news monopolies.

    While a growing body of research studies the initial spatial allocation of refugees, there is little causal evidence
    on subsequent policies that restrict residential mobility. We study a contentious law in Germany, which barred
    refugees from moving to a location different from the one they were randomly assigned to. To identify the causal
    effect of the movement restriction on integration, we utilize a sharp date cutoff that governs whether refugees are
    affected by the policy. We demonstrate that restricting freedom of movement had pronounced negative effects on
    refugees' sense of belonging in Germany while increasing identification with their home countries. In addition, the
    policy decreased engagement in a variety of social activities. Our findings suggest that discriminatory policies
    send a negative signal about the inclusiveness of the host society and thereby reduce the psychological integration
    of refugees.

<i><a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('inheritance');">[Abstract]</a></i>
<div id="inheritance" style="display:none;"><br> Why are some societies more unequal than others? The French revolutionaries believed unequal inheritances among siblings to be responsible for the strict hierarchies of the ancien regime. To achieve equality, the revolutionaries therefore enforced equal inheritance rights. Their goal was to empower women and to disenfranchise the noble class. But do equal inheritances succeed in leveling the societal playing field? We study Germany—a country with pronounced local-level variation in inheritance customs—and find that municipalities that historically equally apportioned wealth, to this day, elect more women into political councils and have fewer aristocrats in the social elite. Using historic data, we point to two mechanisms: wealth equality and pro-egalitarian preferences. In a final step, we also show that, counterintuitively, equitable inheritance customs positively predict income inequality. We interpret this finding to mean that equitable inheritances level the playing field by rewarding talent, not status.</div>

       <i><a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('nimby');">[Abstract]</a></i>
      <div id="nimby" style="display:none;"><br>Affordable housing is a key challenge of the 21st century. A pivotal driver of growing housing prices is residents' opposition to construction, a phenomenon known as NIMBYism ("Not In My Backyard"). To make housing more affordable, city governments are increasingly implementing rent control policies. Does rent control---by making tenants more likely to stay in their apartments---spark NIMBYism and thus exacerbate the housing crisis? We study the case of Berlin, which recently passed a sweeping rent control law. Leveraging two discontinuities in the policy, we show that rent control made tenants less NIMBY. Specifically, tenants in rent controlled apartments became more likely to approve of local-level construction and immigration, compared to tenants in non-rent-controlled apartments. We argue that the decline in NIMBYism is likely due to an economic channel. Tenants in urban centers associate construction and immigration with displacement pressures and gentrification. Rent control alleviates these concerns by providing financial and residential security.

        <i><a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('housing');">[Abstract]</a></i>
        <div id="housing" style="display:none;"><br>Housing shortages and rising rents have increased demands for affordable housing. In this paper, we propose that
        electoral constraints can undermine local politicians' incentives to build public housing. This occurs because voters'
        diverging preferences for spending conflict with municipalities' long-term goals to provide affordable housing.
        Empirically, we draw on the full-count census of all housing built in Germany, data on 19,671 local elections between
        1989 and 2011, and an original survey. Using a difference-in-differences design, we demonstrate that local incumbents
        experience moderate electoral losses after constructing new public housing. We then show that these losses are not
        driven by homeowner opposition or native-foreigner competition. Instead, we develop a novel argument that voters punish
        local incumbents for new municipal housing when they prefer spending on other prioritized policy domains. Our results
        have implications for the origins of the affordability crisis and suggest potential strategies to mitigate electoral
        constraints.

<i><a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('jmp');">[Abstract]</a></i>
<div id="jmp" style="display:none;"><br> How does local media shape policy responses to economic crises? Amidst a shift away from traditional outlets, prior work documents how changes in the media landscape affect constituents' attitudes and behavior, but we know less about the downstream consequences for tangible policy outcomes. In this paper, I present new and comprehensive evidence on the relationship between local government responses to economic crises and the availability of local news. Theoretically,  local news may (i) increase accountability, increasing congruence between voter preferences and policy outcomes, but also (ii) change constituents' preferences by exposing them to information on the negative repercussions of a crisis. To study these mechanisms, I compile a fourteen-year panel of key fiscal policy outcomes for 2,193 German municipalities, focusing on the critical areas of business and property taxation. Using a difference-in-differences design, I first show that local governments in areas more strongly affected by the crisis respond by enacting tax cuts for local businesses. I then utilize overlapping media coverage areas to obtain exogenous variation in newspaper availability, demonstrating that business tax cuts are largest in areas with a greater local media presence. Finally, I present survey evidence that is consistent with a mechanism where newspaper reporting on the crisis induces economic anxiety, increasing popular demands for responses that benefit the struggling local economy. These results have implications for research on the interplay between media and policy outcomes, as well as for work on democratic accountability more broadly.  </div>

<i><a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('covid');">[Abstract]</a></i>
<div id="covid" style="display:none;"><br> Do political and social features of states help explain the evolving distribution of reported Covid-19 deaths? We identify national-level political and social characteristics that past research suggests may help explain variation in a society's ability to respond to adverse shocks. We highlight four sets of arguments---focusing on (1) state capacity, (2) political institutions, (3) political priorities, and (4) social structures---and report on their evolving association with cumulative Covid-19 deaths. After accounting for a simple set of Lasso-chosen controls, we find that measures of government effectiveness, interpersonal and institutional trust, bureaucratic corruption and ethnic fragmentation are currently associated in theory-consistent directions. We do not, however, find associations between deaths and many other political and social variables that have received attention in public discussions, such as populist governments or women-led governments. Currently, the results suggest that state capacity is more important for explaining Covid-19 mortality than government accountability to citizens, with potential implications for how the disease progresses in high-income versus low-income countries. These patterns may change over time with the evolution of the pandemic, however.

(with Matthew Blackwell, Adam Glynn and Connor Phillips)
<i><a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('did');">[Abstract]</a></i>
<div id="did" style="display:none;"><br> Political scientists are increasingly interested in controlled direct effects, which are important quantities of interest for understanding why, how, and when causal effects will occur. Unfortunately, their identification has usually required strong and often unreasonable selection-on-observeables assumptions for the mediator. In this paper, we show how to identify and estimate controlled direct effects under a difference-in-differences design where we have measurements of the outcome and mediator before and after treatment assignment. This design allows us to weaken the identification assumptions to allow for linear, time-constant unmeasured confounding between the mediator and the outcome. Furthermore, we develop a semiparametrically efficient and multiply robust estimator for these quantities and apply our approach to a recent experiment evaluating the effectiveness of short conversations at reducing intergroup prejudice. An open-source software package implements the methodology with a variety of flexible, machine-learning algorithms to avoid bias from misspecification.

<i><a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('gender');">[Abstract]</a></i>
<div id="gender" style="display:none;"><br> What accounts for differences in electoral success between male and female candidates? We exploit features of the German mixed electoral system and a decomposition strategy to study the contribution of parties systematically nominating female candidates to run in districts where the party is less popular, and distinguish it from voter behavior (e.g., discrimination). Using a panel of all electoral districts in eleven federal elections (1983--2021), we document that the relative under-performance of female candidates nominated by the two largest parties can be explained by this systematic nomination behavior that adversely affects female candidates. Moreover, parties' nominations strategies can explain most of the variation in gender gaps in electoral performance across parties and election years. We do not find evidence that bias among voters systematically contributes to candidate gender differences in vote shares. Our findings thus suggest that efforts to address female under-representation that focus on party gatekeepers may be more effective than those addressing voter behavior

(with Hans Lueders and Sascha Riaz)

<div id="gdr" style="display:none;"><br> Citizens in authoritarian regimes frequently communicate grievances to the government. While there is some evidence that governments respond to such petitions, little is known about the nature of this responsiveness: can petitions yield tangible improvements to citizens' livelihoods? To answer this question, we assemble a novel panel of housing-related petitions to the government of the German Democratic Republic (GDR) and all housing constructed between 1945-1989. Exploiting the timing of the largest housing program in 1971, we employ a difference-in-differences design to show that construction was targeted at regions with higher rates of petitioning. We then use a variance decomposition method to benchmark the importance of petitions against objective indicators of housing need. Our results suggest that petitions allow citizens to meaningfully influence the allocation of public resources. The paper contributes to nascent scholarship on responsiveness in non-democratic regimes and shows that responsiveness leads to tangible improvements in citizens' livelihoods.
