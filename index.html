    <p>I am an Assistant Professor of Politics and International Affairs at Princeton Univeristy. My research lies at the
    intersection of Comparative Politics, Gender and Politics, and the Political Economy of Development. 
	    I am interested in understanding the cause and consequences of gender inequality, and in analyzing policy interventions that lower gender inequality in politics. My work leverages a range of research
    designs and data sources, including natural experiments, large-scale surveys, ethnographic research, and administrative data.</p>

    <p>Previously, I was a post-doctoral scholar at the <a
      href="https://academy.wcfia.harvard.edu">Harvard Academy</a>. I am affiliated as a non-resident visiting fellow with the <a href="https://casi.sas.upenn.edu">Center for the Advanced Study of India, UPenn</a>. I completed my PhD in Political Science in 2021 at the </a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk">University of Oxford</a>, where I was a member of </a href="https://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk">Nuffield College</a>. 
      

    <p>

  Based on my <a href="https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:6bb8a8f6-7e8a-45c8-a4d8-073331a7fac5">dissertation</a>, my book manuscript "Representation from Below" examines the political economy logic underlying descriptive representation and party activism and its effects on political behaviour, governance, and party building in the Global South. I rely on natural experiments in the Indian and the Brazilian case. I propose a new perspective on how marginalized groups leverage descriptive representation, demonstrating that women politicians bring about change because they are more likely than men to recruit women as grassroots party activists. 
	    My book manuscript demonstrates how inclusive party building and grassroots party networks can be a tool for social and political change.

      <div id="newspaper2" style="display:none;"><br> This article investigates voter responsiveness to the world’s largest rural roads program, a highly visible development program that improved connectivity for one-third of humanity that previously lacked road access. Investigating 180,000 roads provided across half a million Indian villages aggregated across multiple elections over the last 20 years, the article finds that road provision fails to boost electoral support for the ruling party. Exploiting population-based implementation rules that partly determine road allocation, instrumental variable regressions show that voters remain unresponsive to exogenous road provision. Exploiting subnational variation in implementation and political alignment, analysis shows that factors that breakdown the accountability chain, such as quality, salience, myopia, corruption, or attribution concerns, do not explain these results. The findings suggest that weak accountability presents a more enduring challenge to democracy than assumed in theoretical models and policy interventions.

      <div id="newspaper2" style="display:none;"><br> Extensive research investigates the impact of descriptive representation on women’s political participation; yet, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This article develops a novel theory of descriptive representation, arguing that women politicians mobilize women’s political participation by recruiting women as grassroots party activists. Evidence from a citizen survey and the natural experiment of gender quotas in India confirm that women politicians are more likely to recruit women party activists, and citizens report greater contact with them in reserved constituencies during elections. Furthermore, with women party activists at the helm, electoral campaigns are more likely to contact women, and activist contact is positively associated with political knowledge and participation. Evidence from representative surveys of politicians and party activists and fieldwork in campaigns, further support the theory. The findings highlight the pivotal role of women’s party activism in shaping women’s political behavior, especially in contexts with pervasive clientelism and persistent gender unequal norms.

      <div id="newspaper2" style="display:none;"><br> This article highlights a new way in which descriptive representation enhances democracy through inclusive party building. We theorize that parties retain and promote incumbents based on gendered criteria, disproportionately incentivizing women to recruit party members. However, gendered resource inequalities lower women’s access to the patronage required for recruitment. Women respond by recruiting more women members, as it lowers recruitment costs, is role-congruent, and eases credit claiming. Using rich administrative data on party membership from 2004 to 2020 and a regression discontinuity design in Brazil, we find that, despite resource disparities, women mayors recruit new members at similar rates as men but reduce the gender gap in party membership. As expected, women are more likely to be promoted in constituencies where they most lower the gender gap in party membership. We also find that women’s increased membership improves party resilience. Our findings suggest that descriptive representation strengthens party building by including underrepresented citizens.

        <i><a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('housing');">[Abstract]</a></i>
        <div id="housing" style="display:none;"><br>Housing shortages and rising rents have increased demands for affordable housing. In this paper, we propose that
        electoral constraints can undermine local politicians' incentives to build public housing. This occurs because voters'
        diverging preferences for spending conflict with municipalities' long-term goals to provide affordable housing.
        Empirically, we draw on the full-count census of all housing built in Germany, data on 19,671 local elections between
        1989 and 2011, and an original survey. Using a difference-in-differences design, we demonstrate that local incumbents
        experience moderate electoral losses after constructing new public housing. We then show that these losses are not
        driven by homeowner opposition or native-foreigner competition. Instead, we develop a novel argument that voters punish
        local incumbents for new municipal housing when they prefer spending on other prioritized policy domains. Our results
        have implications for the origins of the affordability crisis and suggest potential strategies to mitigate electoral
        constraints.
